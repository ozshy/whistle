R-code for reproducing Figure  4 (and other simulations) in an article entitled:

"Whistleblowers and Product Safety"

By, Oz Shy

The R-code "whistle_yyyy_mm_dd.R" draws Figure 4 and in the paper. It also simulates (verifies) other results. To use this code, follow 2 steps: (i) Initially, run the entire R-code (from start to end) to ensure that all parameters are defined. (ii) Then, if you are using R-Studio, you can use bookmarks to access the particular Figure that you wish to simulate.

All algebraic derivations for the above article (not related to the R-code) can be found on "whistle_yyyy_mm_dd.dfw.pdf" (which the reader can download). The reader can then scroll down to the desired derivation using the same section, subsection, and equation numbers correspoding to the paper itself.

The above PDF file was constructed using a symbolic algebra software called "Derive for Windows." The file "whistle_yyyy_mm_dd.dfw" requires this sofware (which most people don't have). Therefore, it is sufficient for the reader to download only the above PDF.
